# CSED211: Introduction to Computer Software Systems (Fall 2023)

This repository contains solutions for all 7 lab assignments from POSTECH's **CSED211: Introduction to Computer Software Systems** course.

## Lab Assignments Overview

### Lab 1: Data Lab1 (Bit Manipulation)
Implemented functions using only bitwise operations to simulate logical and arithmetic behaviors, such as `bitNor`, `isZero`, and `logicalShift`.

### Lab 2: Data Lab2 (Floating Point)
Worked with IEEE floating-point representation and implemented low-level operations like `float_abs`, `float_twice`, and conversions between `int` and `float`.

### Lab 3: Bomb Lab (Binary Exploitation)
Reverse-engineered a binary with GDB to defuse six phases and a secret phase using input reasoning and disassembly analysis.

### Lab 4: Attack Lab (Buffer Overflow & ROP)
Used buffer overflow and return-oriented programming techniques to hijack control flow and execute specific target functions.

### Lab 5: Cache Lab
Built a cache simulator and implemented an efficient matrix transpose to reduce cache misses using blocking strategies.

### Lab 6: Shell Lab
Implemented a mini shell that supports job control, background/foreground processes, and signal handling like `SIGINT` and `SIGTSTP`.

### Lab 7: Malloc Lab (Dynamic Memory Allocation)
Implemented a dynamic memory allocator using an implicit free list. Supported functions include `malloc`, `free`, and `realloc`, with coalescing and heap extension logic.

Each lab folder contains the source code and report documenting the design decisions and implementation strategies.
